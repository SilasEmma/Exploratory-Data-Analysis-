# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
A little EDA perform using Facebook generated dumb datasets, not actually Facebook dataset

After learning R programming language for data analysis, I downloaded this file to practice my skills acquired.

Actually the Facebook datasets consist of 99003 rows with 15 columns.

Note: out of the 15 columns about 2 columns have missing value.

Observation
1. Using histogram and facet wrap to plot or display friends count for both male and female.
take out: male users have more friends count than the female users base on the plot.

2. Using histogram to plot or display age range with account
take out: most facebook users who actively have account, are between the age 19-40. Have the highest number of facebook user.
also an outlier was detect, user with age range between 101-110 have the second highest friend count
